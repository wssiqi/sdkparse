		license to use the SDK solely to develop applications to run on the
		Android platform.

		relevant countries).

		public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those
		users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other
		login information or personal information, you must make the users
		aware that the information will be available to your application, and
		you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for
		those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive
		information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
		provides your application with Google Account information, your
		application may only use that information to access the user's Google
		Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
		given you permission to do so.

		4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
		including the development or distribution of an application, that

		manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any
		third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile
		communications carrier.

		no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your
		obligations under this License Agreement, any applicable third party
		contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and
		for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any
		third party may suffer) of any such breach.


		5. Your Developer Credentials


		5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the
		confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you
		by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely
		responsible for all applications that are developed under your

		6. Privacy and Information


		6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may
		collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not
		limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number

		SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this
		information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your
		consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
		collected.

		6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK
		and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.

		experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third
		party applications, data, content, or resources.

		lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on
		these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless
		you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
		owners.

		7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data,
		content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and
		the relevant third party. In that case, this License Agreement does
		not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.


		8. Using Android APIs


		8.1 Google Data APIs

		8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that
		the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are
		owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other
		persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be
		subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent,
		lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
		data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms
		of Service.

		8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you

		you use the service, or the provision of the SDK or certain SDK
		services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
		commercially viable.

		9.4 When this License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights,
		obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from,
		been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst this License
		Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
		indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
		provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights,
		obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

		respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against
		any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and
		all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
		reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your
		use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that
		infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent
		or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any
		person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
		non-compliance by you with this License Agreement.


		13. Changes to the License Agreement


		13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes

		and Google in relation to the Google TV Add-on.

		14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right
		or remedy which is contained in this License Agreement (or which
		Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be
		taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights
		or remedies will still be available to Google.

		14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this
		matter, rules that any provision of this License Agreement is invalid,
		then that provision will be removed from this License Agreement
		without affecting the rest of this License Agreement. The remaining
		provisions of this License Agreement will continue to be valid and
		enforceable.

		14.4 You acknowledge and agree that Google’s API data licensors and each
		member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall
		be third party beneficiaries to this License Agreement and that such
		other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon,
		any provision of this License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or
		rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company
		shall be third party beneficiaries to this License Agreement.

		14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE GOOGLE TV ADD-ON IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES
		EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND
		INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE GOOGLE TV
		ADD-ON. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND
		END USE.

		14.6 The rights granted in this License Agreement may not be assigned or
		transferred by either you or Google without the prior written approval
		of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to
		delegate their responsibilities or obligations under this License
		Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

		14.7 This License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under this
		License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of
		California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and
		Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
		located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any
		legal matter arising from this License Agreement. Notwithstanding
		this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for
		injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
		any jurisdiction.
